## Hi there 👋

- I am Anoob Prakash, computational biologist and population geneticist studying climate change adaptation of trees.
- I am currently working on climate adaptation in black walnut, white oak and short leaf pine.
- I am employing machine learning approaches to use the genomic data of the trees to predict species adaptation to climate change in the near future.

## Education

  Ph.D. in Plant Biology, University of Vermont
